# C++ Commands

This repository is making the C++ projects easier to work with.

## cpp-init

Creates the basic structure for a C++ project, containing a basic hello-world
print in it.

Creating an alias for this script is highly recommended!

```bash
alias cpp-init=`~/.scripts/cpp-commands/initialization.sh'
```

## cpp-edit

Opens the main.cpp file.

After that it loops through all the header files and their source files and
opens them with vsplit for each tab.

Creating an alias for this script is highly recommended!

```bash
alias cpp-edit=`~/.scripts/cpp-commands/editor.sh'
```

## Plans for later

Making an install script against the manual alias creations.
